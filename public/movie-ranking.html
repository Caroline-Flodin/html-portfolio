<h1>The Best Movies According to Caroline</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>It is simply a classic fantasy movieseries and Peter Jackson did a wonderful job with it!</p>

<h3>The Illusionist</h3>
<p>This movie is great for those who like plot-twists and magictricks. It contains both suspense, mystery, romance and a speck of history.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>Although I prefer the books I can't call myself an Harry Potter fan without including one of the movies in this list. 
    My favorite in the series is the prisoner of Azkaban in part due to it being compliant with the books.</p>
